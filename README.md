# BasicParkour
 
# Overview

In this project, I've developed a basic Unity parkour game aimed at learning new skills as a software engineer and deepening my understanding of game development concepts. The objective of the game is to complete each level by successfully traversing obstacles using jumping movements.

# Development Environment

For this project, I utilized Unity as the game development platform. Unity provides a robust set of tools and features for creating interactive 3D experiences. Additionally, I used C# as the programming language for scripting player logic and behavior within the Unity environment.

# Useful Websites

During the development process, I found the following websites particularly helpful:

* [Unity Learn](https://learn.unity.com/) - Unity's official learning platform with tutorials, documentation, and resources for game development.
* [Coding in Flow](https://www.youtube.com/@codinginflow) - A YouTube channel that offers a wide range of Unity tutorials.

# Future Work

* Improve level design with more diverse and challenging obstacles.
* Implement additional parkour mechanics to gameplay.
* Integrate sound effects and background music to enhance the experience.
* Optimize player controls for smoother gameplay.
